# Final Project
## Todo App Added Features
### Add filtering by tags
The user may wish to see or manage only todos relevant to a specific topic (ie School or Work). Filtering has been added that displays only todos with the selected tag/s.

###  Add Location / Map for Todos
If the todo has a relevant location, for example a meeting place, it may be useful to track that as part of the todo. A location field and button to open the location in a maps app has been added

###  Reorder todos
Sometimes it is useful to create a custom prioritization by rearranging the todo items. The Todo List now supports dragging todos to reorder them.

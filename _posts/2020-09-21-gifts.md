# Getting Gifts for People

**Persona** and Scenario: Someone who has to get a gift for someone. It could be someone’s b-day, anniversary or any other reason. Their relationship to the person getting the gift could be family, friend, coworker, business partner etc. 

**Trigger:** Maybe the user was reminded of someone’s event by a calendar app or something. Maybe they just remembered on their own. Maybe they just randomly decided to get someone a gift. 

**Desired Outcome:** They found and purchased and gave the gift to someone. 

**Base Knowledge:** I expect the user knows the person they are getting the gift for. I expect they know at least a little about the person, for example what hobbies they have. I expect the user knows how much they are willing to pay for the gift and that they know when they would like to give the gift by. 

**Required Knowledge:** The user is required to know how much they are willing to pay for a gift. They are also required to know when they need to give the gift by.

**Artifacts:**

- Search engine
- Websites for gift ideas
- Amazon / purchasing service
- Store with physical location (Target, gift shop etc)

Information:

- When they need the gift by
- How much they are willing to pay
- Information about the person they are purchasing the gift for.
